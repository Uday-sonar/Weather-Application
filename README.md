# Weather-Application
Developed a web application to display real-time weather information using city name input. The application fetches live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed along with a 5-day temperature forecast trend. This project helps users plan daily activities based on weather insights.
